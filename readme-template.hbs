# uPort Persona
A library for creating, updating and reading attributes and claims on uport personas. It's intended as an easy interface to the uport-registry, allowing developers to focus on the actual data instead of the datastructure of the object stored in the registry.

## Running tests
Make sure that you have ipfs and testrpc running, then run:
```
npm test
```
